Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

6.7.2
-----

#. **Deprecated the package.**
#. Added a new ``ckeditor/fixups.js`` script which disables the version check
   *again* (if something slips through by accident) and which disables the
   behavior where CKEditor 4 would automatically attach itself to unrelated
   HTML elements with a ``contenteditable`` attribute (see
   ``CKEDITOR.disableAutoInline`` in the CKEditor 4 docs).

6.7.1
-----

#. Silenced the CKEditor version check and associated nag message in the
   frontend. Added a system check of our own which tells people to look for
   alternatives.

-----

#. CKEditor 4.22.1
#. Dark mode fixes.
#. Added support for Pillow 10.

6.4.0
-----
#. Changed the context for the widget to deviate less from Django. Removed a

   ``ckeditor/widget.html`` template. This only affects you if you are using a
   customized widget or widget template.
