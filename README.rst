Installation
------------

Required
~~~~~~~~
#. Install or add django-ckeditor to your python path.

#. Add ``ckeditor`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

#. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies an relative path to your CKEditor media upload directory. CKEditor uses Django storage API. By default Django uses file system storage backend (it will use your MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL) and if you don't use different backend you have to have write permissions for the CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH path within MEDIA_ROOT, i.e.::


    CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = "uploads/"

   For the default file system storage images will be uploaded to "uploads" folder in your MEDIA_ROOT and urls will be created against MEDIA_URL (/media/uploads/image.jpg).

   CKEditor has been tested with django FileSystemStorage and S3BotoStorage.
   There are issues using S3Storage from django-storages.

#. Run the ``collectstatic`` management command: ``$ /manage.py collectstatic``. This'll copy static CKEditor require media resources into the directory given by the ``STATIC_ROOT`` setting. See `Django's documentation on managing static files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files>`_ for more info.

#. Add CKEditor URL include to your project's ``urls.py`` file::

    (r'^ckeditor/', include('ckeditor.urls')),

#. Note that by adding those URLs you add views that can upload and browse through uploaded images. Since django-ckeditor 4.4.6 those views are staff_member_required. If you want different permission decorator (login_required, user_passes_test etc.) then add views defined in `ckeditor.urls` manualy to you urls.py.

#. Set ``CKEDITOR_IMAGE_BACKEND`` to one of supported backends to enable thumbnails in ckeditor gallery. By default no thumbnails are created and full size images are used as preview. Supported backends:

   - ``pillow``: uses PIL or Pillow
   
#. Add a ``CKEDITOR_WINDOWSMODE=True`` setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file when you are debugging with windows platform or it will raise a error
   See https://github.com/shaunsephton/django-ckeditor/issues/119

#. Add a ``CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_URL`` setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file just like ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``
   Do not end with ``/``

#. **django-ckeditor uses jQuery in ckeditor-init.js file. You must set ``CKEDITOR_JQUERY_URL`` to a jQuery URL that will be used to load the library**. If you have jQuery loaded from a different source just don't set this variable and django-ckeditor will not try to load its own jQuery. Example::

       CKEDITOR_JQUERY_URL = '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js'


Optional
~~~~~~~~
#. All uploaded files are slugified by defaults, to disable this feature set ``CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_SLUGIFY_FILENAME`` to ``False``

#. Set the CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER setting to ``True`` in the project's ``settings.py`` file (default ``False``). This restricts access to uploaded images to the uploading user (e.g. each user only sees and uploads their own images). Superusers can still see all images. **NOTE**: This restriction is only enforced within the CKEditor media browser.

#. Add a CKEDITOR_CONFIGS setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This specifies sets of CKEditor settings that are passed to CKEditor (see CKEditor's `Setting Configurations <http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Setting_Configurations>`_), i.e.::

       CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
           'awesome_ckeditor': {
               'toolbar': 'Basic',
           },
       }

   The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a RichTextField::

       content = RichTextField(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')

   The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a CKEditorWidget::

       widget = CKEditorWidget(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')

   By specifying a set named ``default`` you'll be applying its settings to all RichTextField and CKEditorWidget objects for which ``config_name`` has not been explicitly defined ::

       CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
           'default': {
               'toolbar': 'Full',
               'height': 300,
               'width': 300,
           },
       }


Usage
-----

Field
~~~~~
The quickest way to add rich text editing capabilities to your models is to use the included ``RichTextField`` model field type. A CKEditor widget is rendered as the form field but in all other regards the field behaves as the standard Django ``TextField``. For example::

    from django.db import models
    from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField

    class Post(models.Model):
        content = RichTextField()


Widget
~~~~~~
Alernatively you can use the included ``CKEditorWidget`` as the widget for a formfield. For example::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib import admin
    from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget

    from post.models import Post

    class PostAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
        content = forms.CharField(widget=CKEditorWidget())
        class Meta:
            model = Post

    class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = PostAdminForm

    admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)


Note that when using outside of admin panel you will have to make sure all form media is present for the editor to work. You may have to render the media like so::

    <form>
        {{ myform.media }}
        {{ myform.as_p }}
        <input type="submit"/>
    </form>



Managment Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Included is a management command to create thumbnails for images already contained in ``CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH``. This is useful to create thumbnails when starting to use django-ckeditor with existing images. Issue the command as follows::

    $ ./manage.py generateckeditorthumbnails

**NOTE**: If you're using custom views remember to include ckeditor.js in your form's media either through ``{{ form.media }}`` or through a ``<script>`` tag. Admin will do this for you automatically. See `Django's Form Media docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/media/>`_ for more info.

Using S3
~~~~~~~~
See http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


If you want to use allowedContent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To allowedContent works, disable **stylesheetparser** plugin.
So included this on your settings.py.::

    CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
        "default": {
            "removePlugins": "stylesheetparser",
        }
    }


Demo / Test application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you clone the repository you will be able to run the ``ckeditor_demo`` application.

#. ``pip install -r ckeditor_demo_requirements.txt``

#. Run ``python.manage.py syncdb``

#. Create a superuser if you want to test the widget in the admin panel

#. Start the development server.

There is a forms.Form on main page (/) and a model in admin that uses the widget for a model field.
Database is set to sqlite3 and STATIC/MEDIA_ROOT to folders in temporary directory.


Running selenium test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run the test with ``python manage.py test ckeditor_demo`` (for repo checkout only) or with ``tox`` which is configured to run with Python 2.7 and 3.3.
(You may have to fix some imports in selenium webdriver for Python 3.3).


Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~
First two numbers resemble ckeditor version used in the package. The third is used to issue releases for given ckeditor bundle (fixes, new features)
