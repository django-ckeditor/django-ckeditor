GeSHi is a generic syntax highlighter, written in PHP. You simply
input the source code you wish to highlight with the language you
wish to use, and the output will be a file syntax highlighted to
XHTML standards.

For more information on how to use GeSHi, please consult the
documentation. If you got this readme from a GeSHi package, then
the documentation is available in the docs/ directory. Documentation
is also available at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/documentation.php

If you think you've found a bug in GeSHi, contact me with a bug
report at BenBE@omorphia.de, or submit it to the bug tracker at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231. Be
aware that minor highlighting errors may well just be incorrect
language files, but if you do find something major please contact me.

And if you're using GeSHi as a plugin/mod for some other software,
please tell me about it! It's worth a link to you, and I can give
you specialist help if you need it.

COPYING file for more information. If you do modify this program,
please tell me about it! Perhaps you've made a good improvement that
I can learn from :)
